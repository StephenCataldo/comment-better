#### Quick non-developer start

1. Clone or download this repository, 
   Note: Non-developers use only the /build directory of the download.
   Ignore (or even delete) the rest. 
2. In chrome, enter into the address bar:   
chrome://extensions 
2a. Click on
âˆš Developer Mode
2b. Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and the select the extension directory
called "build" within the download/cloned code. 

It should be running! When you go to a website with a keyword for which 
the guide (currently set to CognitivePolitics.com) has a suggestion,
it will be available in a drop-down in the bullhorn next to the address bar
of your browser.

Developers should follow instructions from the boilerplate, below. Note that
the /build directory will often be behind your own    'npm run dev'

#### Purpose & Plan

# guide-comment-insert
When you read an article online, this chrome extension checks a list of keywords of "issues" connected to URLs from a "guide," and makes them accessible. It is intended for commenting: providing cut-and-paste quick replies to articles. 


## Guide to Issues
  
# Phase 1: Expert Guides

When you read an article, this chrome extension checks a list of keywords
of "issues" or topics connected to URLs from a "guide," and makes them
accessible. It is intended for commenting: providing cut-and-paste
quick replies to articles. The initial client is CogntivePolitics.org
and perhaps a facebook group Social Media Approaches for Respect and
Tolerance.

# Phase 1B: Facebook and Twitter.

The main use-case is for commenting on facebook and twitter (as well
as news articles and blogs). Phase 1B is more tight integration with these
particular sites, integrating with posts or tweets instead of entire
pages.

# Phase 2: DIY

This may one day become (or be integrated with) a bookmark tool,
so that when you come across an article you find convincing,
or a well-footnoted source that backs up your opinions on a topic,
 you can connect it to a keyword or hashtag and have it available
when commenting on that topic.

## Thoughts on UX

# When a keyword loads how does user see it?

Original code creates a menu-like link, dropped over the page, kindof 
annoying. Very annoying. Don't do that. Go with the usual extension
approach of adding a little icon next to the top bar. When a keyword is 
found in the page:
1) highlight it.
2) perhaps create a small dropdown menu under the icon at the top. Perhaps
temporary, just long enough to get the mouse to it if people want to react
right away, then out of the way... but having reminded user that the tool
is active for this page.

> Boilerplate for Chrome Extension React.js project.

## Features

 - Simple [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)/[Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) examples of Chrome Extension Window & Popup & Inject pages
 - Hot reloading React/Redux (Using [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) and [React Transform](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform))
 - Write code with ES2015+ syntax (Using [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel))
 - E2E tests of Window & Popup & Inject pages (Using [Chrome Driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver), [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver))

## Examples

The example is edited from [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) TodoMVC example.

#### Popup

![Popup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3001525/14128490/dc05e9f8-f653-11e5-9de6-82d1de01844a.gif)

The `todos` state will be saved to `chrome.storage.local`.

#### Window

![Window](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3001525/14128489/da176b62-f653-11e5-9bff-fefc35232358.gif)

The context menu is created by [chrome/extension/background/contextMenus.js](chrome/extension/background/contextMenus.js).

#### Inject page

The inject script is being run by [chrome/extension/background/inject.js](chrome/extension/background/inject.js). A simple example will be inject bottom of page(`https://github.com/*`) if you visit.

If you are receiving the error message `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE`, you need to allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost. You can do this by visiting the following URL: `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost` and enabling **Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost**.

## Installation

```bash
# clone it
$ git clone https://github.com/jhen0409/react-chrome-extension-boilerplate.git

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Development

* Run script
```bash
# build files to './dev'
# start webpack development server
$ npm run dev
```
* If you're developing Inject page, please allow `https://localhost:3000` connections. (Because `injectpage` injected GitHub (https) pages, so webpack server procotol must be https.)
* [Load unpacked extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) with `./dev` folder.

#### React/Redux hot reload

This boilerplate uses `Webpack` and `react-transform`, and use `Redux`. You can hot reload by editing related files of Popup & Window & Inject page.

#### Using Redux DevTools Extension

You can use [redux-devtools-extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) on development mode.

## Build

```bash
# build files to './build'
$ npm run build
```

## Compress

```bash
# compress build folder to {manifest.name}.zip and crx
$ npm run build
$ npm run compress -- [options]
```

#### Options

If you want to build `crx` file (auto update), please provide options, and add `update.xml` file url in [manifest.json](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate#update_url manifest.json).

* --app-id: your extension id (can be get it when you first release extension)
* --key: your private key path (default: './key.pem')  
  you can use `npm run compress-keygen` to generate private key `./key.pem`
* --codebase: your `crx` file url

See [autoupdate guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate) for more information.

## Test

* `test/app`: React components, Redux actions & reducers tests
* `test/e2e`: E2E tests (use [chromedriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver), [selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver))

```bash
# lint
$ npm run lint
# test/app
$ npm test
$ npm test -- --watch  # watch files
# test/e2e
$ npm run build
$ npm run test-e2e
```
