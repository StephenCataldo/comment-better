                Conversations have metaphors. Do you fire facts like
                artillery forcing the defender to hide in trenches?
                Is this a competive sport, a chance to connect, a mutual
                journey, a session of story-telling and listening?

                Describe the other side's points more clearly than they
                do. If false accusations are being made by your side, be the
                one who steps in. Be seen as reasonable and willing to
                compromise, leaving the other side feeling heard, and people
                will engage with you differently.

                Electoral majorities require a big tent approach. This
                doesn't mean pathetically compromising until you stand for
                nothing. It means expressing your heart fully ("I statements")
                and passionately, but also making sure that
                people can be on your side if they agree with you even 
                a little.
